This is a basic HTML and CSS based web page regarding projects I have done with neoG-camp ?

I have used HTML and CSS to create this web page.

I have tried to use tags like html,head,title,body,header,footer,section,h1-h6,p,a,br,span and many more

I have also created exrernal css file (app.css)

I have tried to use combination of these two colors (50-50%)
Sailor Blue(#00203FFF) and Mint(#ADEFD1FF)
